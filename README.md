D2L-Quiz-Creator
================

A desktop tool that professors can use to create D2L quizzes

MOTIVATION
----------

We had heard from a few professors that the D2L way of creating quizzes is clunky and convoluted. Seeing as we have gotten so much from this school and its faculty, we wanted to give something back. With this creating quizzes for the D2L system will be much easier and easier to access with this offline, desktop application.
